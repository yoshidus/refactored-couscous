For most of our programs, including evictions, we can help applicants with many types of legal status. We can only assist undocumented people if they are survivors of domestic violence as long as the eviction is in some way related to the domestic violence.”
- Police: “With regards to eviction cases, we don't really coordinate with law enforcement. Occasionally we will contact sheriffs' offices to ask them when they are going to execute writs of restitution to remove tenants after an eviction judgment so that we can let the tenant know. On the rare occasion when we get a stay of execution, we also contact the sheriffs' offices to let them know about the stay so that they don't remove the tenant. In other types of cases, we might coordinate with law enforcement to get opposing parties served, let them know when the opposing party is going to be somewhere where they can be served, etc.,”

Source of Income (SOI) Discrimination Report,Government-Run,Seeking Housing,KCMO Residents Only,mailto:CREOcivilrights@kcmo.org for email or call 311,https://www.kcmo.gov/programs-initiatives/faq,"Here's a city website with some information explaining the recent law banning “source of income discrimination” that was passed in Kansas City, MO: https://www.kcmo.gov/city-hall/departments/civil-rights-and-equal-opportunity-creo/civil-rights-division/source-of-income. If you think you've been discriminated against based on this law while applying to properties in Kansas City, MO, you can report the landlord using the following methods:

To file a report of source of income discrimination, call 311, email CREOcivilrights@kcmo.org, or fill out a “Discrimination Report” here: https://www.kcmo.gov/talk-to-us/mykcmo","** KCMO is currently enjoined (prevented) from enforcing the SOI discrimination ban. (This means that, until further notice, landlords are allowed to discriminate again. >_<)

When should we inform callers about the ban on source of income discrimination?
• If they live or are applying for places in KCMO, and…
    ◦ They’re on a voucher, Section 8, SSI, etc and say that they’ve had rental 
      applications rejected as a result
    ◦ They’re having trouble applying to places because of credit score, past 
      convictions, or evictions from more than a year ago
    ◦ Landlords have been denying their application without explaining why, and 
      they fall into one of these categories
    ◦ They’ve been searching for housing and have seen language like “No 
      vouchers,” etc in rental listings
    ◦ They’re on a voucher and are looking to apply to places in KCMO, in general

In KCMO, landlords are banned from:
• Putting things like “No vouchers,” “No felons,” or “No prior evictions” in their listings
• Rejecting a rental application purely because of the applicant’s legal source of income (like Section 8, vouchers, cash tipped wages, or SSI)
• Rejecting a rental application purely because of an eviction that happened more than 1 year ago
• Rejecting a rental application purely because of the applicant’s credit score
• Rejecting a rental application purely because of the existence of a prior criminal conviction
• Rejecting an application based on a rent-to-income ratio for base rent when the applicant is on a voucher
     • Example: If the base rent is $1000, and the applicant has a voucher that
       reduces their share to $300, the landlord couldn’t reject the applicant for not
       making 3x base rent ($3000/month)
     • But they COULD reject the applicant for not making 3x the reduced rent
       ($900/month)
• Increasing charges or treating the tenant worse because of any of the factors listed above
• Rejecting an applicant but refusing to disclose the reasons for their rejection
    ◦ If the applicant requests the reasons for the rejection, the law mandates that
      the landlord informs tenants of their rights under KCMO law, including this 
      source of income law

What isn’t banned?
• The ordinance was passed in Kansas City, MO, so it doesn’t cover any other municipalities (KCK, Raytown, Independence, etc)
• Landlords can still turn down applicants if they have multiple of the above things at once
    ◦ For example, if the applicant has a bad credit score AND an eviction that 
      happened more than 1 year ago, it’s legal to turn them down without any 
      further reasons
• Landlords can still turn down applicants purely based on an eviction on their record, if that eviction was less than 1 year ago
• Landlords can still turn down applicants based on evictions, credit history or criminal records, IF they also include a justification from the following list:
    ◦ “personal references, recency and status of any evictions, and any actions 
       taken by the rental applicant to resolve past evictions, credit challenges, or 
       alleged damages, the recency and severity of any convictions, the violent or 
       sexual nature of any prior convictions, the facts or circumstances 
       surrounding criminal conduct, the age of the applicant at the time of the 
       conduct, the age or vulnerability of the victim of the conduct, evidence that 
       the applicant has maintained a good tenant history in the intervening time, 
       and evidence of rehabilitation efforts,”
    ◦ So for example, a landlord would likely still be able to deny an applicant for:
        ▪ A shoplifting conviction that happened very recently
        ▪ A eviction that happened a while ago, but hasn’t been paid off
        ▪ An assault conviction that happened a long time ago (“violent or sexual 
              nature of any prior convictions”)

How can tenants report suspected discrimination?
• Call 311 (not 211!) and follow instruction provided to file a complaint…
• OR email the CREO (Civil Rights and Equal Opportunity) department…
• OR report in person at the CREO department at City Hall…
• OR file a “discrimination report” here: https://www.kcmo.gov/talk-to-us/mykcmo ","March 11, 2025","English, Spanish",
